## Base Camp

You have been asked to run a vulnerability test on the K2 network in order to see if there is any way that a malicious actor would be able to infiltrate.  
  
The IT team assures you that the network is secure and that you won't be able to make your way up the mountain.  

They have only provided you with their external website called `k2.thm`.

Please allow 3-5 minutes for the VM to fully start.


## Middle Camp

The IT Team can't believe that you have made it past the first server. However, they feel confident that you won't make it much further.  
  
Use all of the information gathered from your previous findings in order to keep making your way to the top.  

Please allow 3-5 minutes for the VM to fully start.

## The Summit

You are almost there; you can see the summit from where you stand. Even the IT team is impressed at how far you have made into the network.  
  
You can't stop now; with all of the information gathered, you will reach the very top and prove your skills.

Please allow 3-5 minutes for the VM to fully start.
